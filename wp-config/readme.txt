'add-to-wp-config.php' contains useful code that should be added to the 'wp-config.php' file located in the root of your website (or in your htdocs/wpdesign folder).
wp-config.php is automatically generated once you install WordPress but can be changed later, and it's intended to be so. You can add the code before the line: "/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */"
